# Nullish helpers

Simple helper functions for nullish values.

## Usage

Import a single helper

```ts
import { andThen } from "@garretmh/nullish/andThen.js";
```

Import all helpers when using multiple

```ts
import * as nullish from "@garretmh/nullish";
```

### Functional programming

Import a functional version of a helper (not all helpers have a functional
variant)

```ts
import { andThen } from "@garretmh/nullish/fp/andThen.js";
```

Import all helpers using functional versions of those that have them

```ts
import * as nullish from "@garretmh/nullish/fp";
```
